Ans: React is known as react for its reactive programming.

Q6. Async VS differ?
Ans: async: Loads the script asynchronously, allowing HTML parsing to continue, and executes it as soon as it's downloaded. Useful for non-essential scripts.

defer: Defers script execution until HTML parsing is complete, ensuring scripts are executed in order before the DOMContentLoaded event. Useful for scripts dependent on HTML structure.

Example: If you have multiple scripts, like script1.js and script2.js, and you want them executed in a specific order, use defer to maintain sequence: <script defer src="script1.js"></script> <script defer src="script2.js"></script>.
